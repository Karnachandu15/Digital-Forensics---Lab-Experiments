# Experiment 7: Use AFLogical OSE to Extract Data from an Android Device

## Aim
To demonstrate the process of extracting digital evidence and user data from an Android device using AFLogical OSE (Open Source Edition) forensics tool.

## Description
AFLogical OSE is an open-source mobile forensics tool designed specifically for Android devices. This experiment focuses on using AFLogical OSE to extract various types of data including SMS messages, call logs, contacts, and other user data from an Android device in a forensically sound manner.

## Tools Used
1. AFLogical OSE Application
2. Android Device (with USB debugging enabled)
3. USB Cable
4. Computer with ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed
5. Data viewing software (for analyzing extracted data)

## Prerequisites
1. Android device with:
   - USB debugging enabled
   - At least 50% battery life
   - Sufficient storage space
2. Computer with:
   - ADB installed and configured
   - Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
   - USB drivers for the target Android device

## Procedure

### 1. Preparation Phase
1. Enable Developer Options on Android device
   - Go to Settings â†’ About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" seven times
   - Enable USB debugging in Developer Options

## Results
The experiment successfully demonstrated:

1. Proper setup and configuration of AFLogical OSE
2. Successful extraction of various data types:
   - SMS Messages: [Number of messages extracted]
   - Call Logs: [Number of calls recorded]
   - Contacts: [Number of contacts retrieved]
   - Browser History: [Number of entries found]
   - Calendar Events: [Number of events extracted]

Key Achievements:
- Established secure connection with target device
- Completed data extraction without altering device contents
- Successfully transferred and verified extracted data
- Maintained forensic integrity throughout the process

## Analysis Findings
1. Data Completeness:
   - Successfully extracted all targeted data types
   - Preserved metadata including timestamps
   - Maintained data structure integrity

2. Tool Effectiveness:
   - AFLogical OSE performed reliably
   - Extraction process was non-invasive
   - Data output format was easily analyzable

## Conclusion
AFLogical OSE proved to be an effective tool for basic Android device forensics. The experiment successfully demonstrated the complete process of extracting digital evidence from an Android device while maintaining forensic integrity. The extracted data provides valuable insights for digital forensic investigations and can be further analyzed using specialized forensic tools.
