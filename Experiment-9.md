# Experiment 9: Use Process Explorer to Identify Suspicious Processes

## Aim
To demonstrate the use of Process Explorer in identifying, analyzing, and investigating suspicious processes running on a Windows system for digital forensics purposes.

## Description
Process Explorer is an advanced system monitoring tool that provides detailed information about which handles and DLLs processes have opened or loaded. This experiment focuses on using Process Explorer to identify potentially malicious processes, analyze their behavior, and determine their impact on system security.

## Tools Used
1. Process Explorer (Sysinternals Suite)
2. Windows Operating System
3. Test processes (both legitimate and suspicious)
4. VirusTotal integration (for malware verification)

## Prerequisites
1. Download and install Process Explorer from Microsoft Sysinternals
2. Administrative privileges on the Windows system
3. Internet connection (for VirusTotal integration)
4. Basic understanding of Windows processes

## Procedure

### 1. Installation and Setup
1. Download Process Explorer from Microsoft's website
2. Extract and run ProcessExplorer.exe
3. Configure Process Explorer settings:
   - Enable "Verify Image Signatures"
   - Configure VirusTotal integration

### 2. Basic Process Analysis
1. Observe the two-pane display:
   - Upper pane: Process list
   - Lower pane: Handle or DLL view

[Insert Screenshot: Place screenshot showing Process Explorer main interface]

2. Understanding the color coding:
   - Purple: Packed processes
   - Pink: Services
   - Blue: New processes
   - Red: Terminated processes

### 3. Identifying Suspicious Processes
1. Check for unusual process names or locations
2. Look for processes with:
   - No description
   - No company name
   - Suspicious file locations
   - High CPU or memory usage

### 4. Process Properties Analysis
1. Right-click suspicious process â†’ Properties
2. Examine:
   - Image path
   - Command line
   - Parent process
   - Start time
   - User account

### 5. VirusTotal Integration
1. Enable VirusTotal submission
2. Check suspicious files:
   - Right-click process
   - Select "Check VirusTotal"

### 6. DLL and Handle Investigation
1. View loaded DLLs:
   - Select process
   - Lower pane: DLL view

2. Analyze handles:
   - Switch to handle view
   - Look for suspicious file/registry handles

### 7. Tree View Analysis
1. View process relationships:
   - Enable tree view
   - Identify parent-child relationships

## Results
The experiment successfully demonstrated:

1. Process Identification:
   - Total processes analyzed: [X]
   - Suspicious processes identified: [X]
   - Confirmed malicious processes: [X]

2. System Analysis:
   - CPU usage patterns
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Network connection analysis
   - File handle investigation

3. Key Findings:
   - Types of suspicious activities detected
   - Common characteristics of malicious processes
   - System resource impact

## Analysis Summary

### 1. Process Characteristics
- Identified suspicious patterns:
  - Unusual file locations
  - Suspicious DLL loading
  - Abnormal parent-child relationships
  - Unexpected network connections

### 2. System Impact
- Resource utilization
- System stability
- Network activity
- File system changes

### 3. Investigation Techniques
1. Effective methods for identifying suspicious processes
2. Verification procedures using VirusTotal
3. Documentation of findings
4. Response procedures

## Conclusion
Process Explorer proved to be a powerful tool for digital forensics investigation by:

1. Providing detailed process information
2. Enabling real-time monitoring of system activities
3. Facilitating malware identification
4. Supporting in-depth analysis of suspicious processes
