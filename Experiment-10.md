# Experiment 10: Use Ghidra to Disassemble and Analyze Malware Code

## Aim
To demonstrate the process of using Ghidra to disassemble, decompile, and analyze malware code for understanding its functionality and potential threats.

## Description
Ghidra is a powerful software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA. This experiment focuses on using Ghidra's features to analyze malware samples, understand their behavior, identify malicious functions, and document findings. The analysis will help in understanding the malware's capabilities and potential impact on systems.

## Tools Used
1. Ghidra (latest version)
2. Java Development Kit (JDK)
3. Virtualized environment (for safety)
4. Sample malware (in a controlled environment)
5. Windows/Linux operating system

## Prerequisites
1. Isolated analysis environment (Virtual Machine)
2. Java Development Kit installed
3. Ghidra installed and configured
4. Test malware samples (safely contained)
5. Basic understanding of assembly language

## Procedure

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Install Java Development Kit
